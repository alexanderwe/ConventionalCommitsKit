## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

To integrate using Apple's [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/), add the following as a dependency to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/alexanderwe/ConventionalCommitsKit.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

Alternatively navigate to your Xcode project, select `Swift Packages` and click the `+` icon to search for `ConventionalCommitsKit`.

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate `ConventionalCommitsKit` into your project manually. Simply drag the `Sources` Folder into your Xcode project.

## Usage

At first import `ConventionalCommitsKit`

```swift
import ConventionalCommitsKit
```

Define a `ConventionalCommit` based on a commit message. Be aware that the parsing can fail and throw an appropriate error.

```swift
let commitMessage = """

on typos fixed.

let commit = try ConventionalCommit(input: commitMessage)
```
